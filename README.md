# Total-Weapon-Replacer

Tired of the usual weapons from Half-life 2? So I present you this mod, which allows you to replace weapons from HL2 with any you want. A minigun instead of a pistol? Easy.
How about a few variations? Sure.
Okay, moving on to the functions that this mod can do:
- You can replace any weapon from HL2 such as Revolver, Pistol, SMG, AR2 and even Gravity Gun.
- The ability to disable replacement for some weapons, such as RPG (especially relevant in the campaign HL2 there fucking helicopters so just do not kill unless RPG).
- And most importantly to choose several variations of replacements for one weapon, for which I made the addon.
- Ability to randomize weapons. Just don't fill the table and the weapons will be randomized

Inspired by this [addon](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2919720308&searchtext=entity+replacer) mod to replace the entity, but it was inconvenient, especially you have to restart the map to apply the settings and limited to add weapons. So I created this miracle

And if you find bugs, please, please, report about bug. I will try to fix them. Also do not mind suggestions for improvement (for example, add something).
